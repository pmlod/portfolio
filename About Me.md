# About Me

I'm a veteran technologist and information services professional with decades of experience in the design, delivery and documentation of knowledge solutions. As the technical director for a leading language services provider, I have spent over a decade building responsive and compliant content solutions for regulated industries.

I'm also a writer and critic. My most recent novel, *The House on Vesper Sands*, was a *Guardian* and *Observer* book of the year and was named one of 2021's best books of the summer by *The New York Times*. My reviews and essays have appeared in *The Irish Times*, *The Guardian*, *The Spectator* and elsewhere.
