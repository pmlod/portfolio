Lexical density is a measurement of the complexity of a language sample. It expresses the proportion of lexical items to the size of the text as a whole. It is given by:

$$
L_d = \frac{N_l}{N} \times 100
$$

where

- $L_d$ is the lexical density of the text, expressed as a percentage;
- $N_l$ is the number of lexical items. Lexical items are meaningful terms like nouns, verbs and adjectives;
- $N$ is the total number of words, including both lexical and grammatical items. Grammatical items are words or lexemes (word components) that connect meaningful terms to form clauses or sentences.

### Adding lexical density to an analysis job

**Note**: .

1. In **Analysis Workbench**, open **My analysis jobs**.
2. Select **New job**.
3. Select the **Language Properties** tab.
4. Using the **Select Language Properties** tree control, expand the **Complexity** branch and ensure that **Lexical density** is checked.

### Interpreting lexical density scores

Language complexity is an active area of research, and many approaches are taken to defining and measuring it. 

Higher lexical density scores tend to correlate with higher reading difficulty, but you should bear the following
