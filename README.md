# About this repo

This is a portfolio repo containing samples of my technical writing projects.

## Language and Style

I am a native of Dublin, Ireland, so by default I write in Irish English, which shares most of its spelling conventions with British English. However, since US English predominates in technical writing, my samples have been chosen accordingly. Other aspects of style and terminology may reflect the preferences and conventions of specific user communities.

## Tool chain

I have worked with all major authoring platforms, content management systems and IDEs, from FrameMaker and Confluence to Oxygen, Obsidian and VSCode. To create this portfolio, I used a minimal tool chain that reflects my personal preferences: VSCode and the Git CLI.
