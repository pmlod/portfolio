# Readme | pmlod/portfolio

This is a portfolio repo containing samples of my technical writing projects. Since almost all of my work product is the intellectual property of former employers and clients, these samples have been adapted and anonymised in various ways. However, the subject matter areas, products and solutions they cover do represent some of my areas of special expertise.

## Language and Style

I am a native of Dublin, Ireland, so by default I write in Irish English, which shares its spelling conventions with British English. However, since US English predominates in technical writing, my samples have been chosen accordingly. Other aspects of style and terminology may reflect the preferences and conventions of specific user communities.
