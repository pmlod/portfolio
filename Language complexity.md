# Language complexity

Language complexity is a challenging problem in linguistics and information theory. No methodologies have yet been identified that account for all markers of complexity across a wide spectrum of languages.

Nonetheless, a number of statistical techniques have proved useful in assessing language complexity as a measure of relative difficulty for readers of lower proficiency.




## Core complexity features

[[Lexical density]]
[[Lexical diversity]]
Sentence length

## Readability indices

Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level

## Stylistic complexity features

[!NOTE] These checks identify usages and language features that some readers may find difficult. You should consider the needs of your target audience when applying these checks, since the appropriateness of most stylistic features is context-dependent.

Passive voice
Subordinate or dependent clauses
Subjunctive voice
Specialist terminology
Non-inclusive language


## Guidelines and best practices

These checks can be used to identify language and formatting features corresponding to

Persuasive language
Numeracy features
