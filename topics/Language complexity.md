# Language complexity

Language complexity is a challenging problem in linguistics and information theory. Languages encode complexity in many ways, and no methodologies have emerged that account for all of these.

Nonetheless, some statistical techniques have been shown to correlate well with common measurements of reading proficiency. Additionally, checks focused on complexity, readability, and stylistic discourse markers can be combined to create holistic content performance benchmarks tailored for your audiences and content personas.
