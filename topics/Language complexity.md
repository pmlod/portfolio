# Language complexity

Language complexity is a challenging problem in linguistics and information theory. Languages encode complexity in differing ways, and no widely useful methodologies have been identified that encompass all of these.

Nonetheless, a number of statistical techniques have been shown to correlate with common measurements of reading proficiency, though such techniques may be limited in the range of languages to which they can be applied.

In addition to these core language complexity metrics, ContentLab implements a number of standard readability indices and checks for a range of stylistic complexity markers. As with all quantitative measures of natural language features, you should consider the context and the needs of the audience when interpreting results.


## Core complexity features

- [Lexical density](Lexical%20density.md)

- [Lexical diversity](Lexical%20diversity.md)

- Sentence length

## Readability indices



- Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level

## Stylistic complexity features

- Passive voice
- Subordinate or dependent clauses
- Subjunctive voice
- Specialist terminology
- Non-inclusive language


## Guidelines and best practices

These checks can be used to identify language and formatting features corresponding to

Persuasive language
Numeracy features
