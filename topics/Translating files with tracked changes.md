## Introduction

Microsoft Word allows users to track revisions to a document using a markup format that identifies inserted or deleted text. XLab preserves this markup when converting Word documents to XLIFF format, allowing them to be translated while protecting the tracked changes metadata.

When you open an XLIFF file containing preexisting tracked changes, the **Track changes** menu is displayed and the menu item **Track changes** > **Allow revision tracking** is enabled automatically. Where the source document does not contain tracked changes, you can introduce them at any time by manually enabling the **Allow revision tracking** option.
