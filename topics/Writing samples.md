# Writing samples

## Technical documentation

I have produced user guides, online help, release notes, wikis and other content categories for a wide range of SaaS applications, desktop applications, tools and frameworks. I also have extensive experience in medical writing and have provided specialist consulting on plain language and accessibility to life sciences enterprises.

The samples collected here have been modified to protect the IP of former employers and clients. Samples of my creative writing (and buy links for my published work) can be found at https://vspr.st/.
